# News-Reccomender-and-Trend-Predictor
In this notebook, I built both a reccomendation engine for news articles and used NLP to predict trends in the news. I did both to gain a better understanding of how news is shared on the internet and which metrics -- such as engagement, post times, and more -- play a role into publication.  I also offer explanatory analysis to better contextualize the data and draw conclusions from there, based on both the statistics and my experience as a journalist working in professional newsrooms.
